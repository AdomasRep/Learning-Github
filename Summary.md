# [Git & Github Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&list=WL&index=10)

I believe only watching the tutorial would be useless. Therefore, I followed all the steps on my computer (index.html and README.md) and made a summary of the things I learned. I am storing this file here with the intention to learn additional [text formating skills](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
